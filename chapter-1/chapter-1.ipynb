    "Foundation models represent a significant change in the realm of deep learning. Unlike traditional methods that train models using labeled datasets, foundation models leverage extensive volumes of broad, unlabeled data. Pretraining these models on sizable datasets facilitates faster adaptation to downstream tasks with less labeled data. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with remote sensing data, where labeled datasets are rare and costly to acquire.\n",

It's a type of neural network architecture that employs attention mechanisms (as seen in Fig. 2) to comprehend contextual relationships between different parts of the input.

    "In the realm of computer vision, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been the preferred architecture for many years, primarily due to their efficiency and ability to emulate the visual cortex. However, with the success of transformers in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain (including BERT, BART, GPT, LLaMa), Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been introduced as a novel architecture for computer vision tasks, with performance on-par or exceeding CNNs. Here, images are viewed as sequences of image patches. Feature maps are modeled as vectors of tokens, each token representing an embedding of a specific image patch. ViTs have an edge over CNNs because they are less subject to the inductive biases that CNNs face (like assumptions of locality and weight sharing). Moreover, ViTs possess a larger global receptive field (the ability to 'attend' to the entire image simultaneously). One disadvantage of ViTs is their computational expense for training, requiring substantial compute and memory resources. CNNs, on the other hand, benefit from years of operator and library optimization, making them more efficient to train.\n",

    "The pretraining of transformers helps the model learn how to extract features from unlabeled data. This process generally employs two main strategies: self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) and Masked Image Modeling (MIM). CL typically involves augmenting an image and minimizing the distance between the augmented image and the original image in the embedding space. Conversely, MIM involves masking a portion of the image and predicting the masked section. The pretraining process is illustrated in Fig. 4.\n",

    "# Notes on Fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning Vision Foundation Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a vision foundation model, like a Vision Transformer (ViT), has been pretrained on a large, unlabeled dataset, it's ready to be fine-tuned for specific tasks. Fine-tuning is a procedure that tailors a pretrained model to work on a particular task with a smaller labeled dataset. This process allows us to leverage the knowledge gained by the model during pretraining and adjust it to many tasks. Here's how it generally works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Task-Specific Dataset Preparation**: First step requires compilation of labeled dataset for a specific task on interest. This dataset is typically smaller than what is required for training a model from scratch, but needs to be similar in signature to the original pretraining dataset. It could be a collection of images labeled with classes for object recognition, bounding boxes for object detection, or any other labeling that corresponds to the specific vision task.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize with Pretrained Weights**: We begin by initializing your vision transformer model with the weights learned during pretraining. This is the primary difference between training a model from scratch and fine-tuning - instead of starting with random weight initialization, we are starting with weights that already have some representation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Adjustment by Fine Tuning**: During the fine-tuning process, the weights of the pretrained model are adjusted using backpropagation and gradient descent, as with normal training. However, since the model is already close to the optimal solution, the updates made to the weights during training are typically quite small. The simplest approach is to fine-tune all the layers of the model. However, we can also choose to freeze (or hold constant) the earlier layers of the model (which often capture more generic features), and only fine-tune some of the later layers (which capture more task-specific features). You can also add one or more fully-connected layers at the end of the model and only train these layers on the new data. Typically very small learning rate is employed to preserve the original weights (this is a problem known as catastrophic forgetting) and avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation and Iteration**: Finally, the fine-tuned model is evaluated on a separate test set to measure its performance. \n",
    "By leveraging pre-trained models, we are able to reduce the amount of labeled data required to train a model for a specific task. This is particularly useful in the remote sensing domain, where labeled datasets are often scarce and costly to acquire. We also spend less time and effort in training the model due to pre-emptive compute. \n",
    "\n",
    "## MMSegmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the popular segmentation library, [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation) for finetuning our Vision transformer. MMSegmentation is a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://github.com/open-mmlab) computer vision library. While the library supports various backbones and methods of segmentation, we particularly used ViT backbone with MAE masking strategy. For segmentation method, [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) architecture was used."
